                <h2>Angel's Landing</h2>

                    <p>
                        A beautiful hike along a tall ridge that juts into the canyon.
                        Sections were very steep, and some very narrow, with thousand
                        foot drop&#8209;offs just feet away on either side of the path.
                    </p>

                <h2>Canyoneering</h2>

                    <p>
                        This was all in slot canyons on the Kolob Terrace, outside of the park itself.
                        We had a couple of guides. They were pretty rad.

                <h2>The Narrows</h2>

                    <p>
                        This was a hike through the northern canyons,
                        much of it through the river itself.
                        The canyon walls were very close together,
                        and towered hundreds of feet overhead,
                        hence the name &quot;The Narrows.&quot;
                        Every turn was a beautiful new sight to take in.
