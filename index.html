                                A beautiful hike along a tall ridge that juts into the canyon.
                                Sections were very steep, and some very narrow, with thousand
                                foot drop&#8209;offs just feet away on either side of the path.

                                This was all in slot canyons on the Kolob Terrace,
                                outside of the park itself.
                                We had a couple of guides. They were pretty rad.

                                This was a hike through the northern canyons,
                                much of it through the river itself.
                                The canyon walls were very close together,
                                and towered hundreds of feet overhead,
                                hence the name &quot;The Narrows.&quot;
                                Every turn was a beautiful new sight to take in.
